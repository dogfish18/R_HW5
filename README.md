This assignment reminds me of this poem:

# Computer Problems

Stupid computer, keeps locking up all the time,
Trying to submit a new poem, I hope it rhymes.
It stops here, it stops there,
deleting my unsaved documents, the annoyance, I can't bear.

It deleted all of my assignments, now I have to start again,
I need a new computer but how and when,
The thing is too big, I have no muscles at all,
I've got the mouse but how do I get the screen off the wall.

I am a computer geek but not a mechanic,
There are sparks flying from the motherboard, now I start to panic.
The screen is flickering there's something wrong,
Yep, it's a virus, I knew it all along.

I've got to back-up my hard drive, need to do it fast,
It just deleted every one of my emails and photos, blast!
for my other computers, I will get antivirus from here on.
But before I could pull out my hard drive, it reset, now everything's...gone.
